# P-PIG: the Pasvik Precipitation Information Generator

Welcome to the interactive rain-information for Pasvik weather station

Or the rather dashing name: P-PIG!

### Motivation for analysis
As I have no specific master thesis yet, I decided to look into relevant weather-data for Pasvik, 
where I'm most likley writing my thesis on lichen growth. We will look into lichen growth during the last 15, 10, 5 and 0 years, and therefore require to look into the amount of rain that has fallen during different periods of time. That is why I chose to focus on the ability to choose and store a user-decided period of years, and creating a script depending on user input.

As lichen-growth is most dependent on the precipitation during summer, this generator focuses on summer-measurments from the months april-september.

Data has been downloaded from Norsk KlimeserviceSenter, Metrologiske institutt: https://seklima.met.no/observations/

### Short Pipeline description
Several periods of years can be chosen, and in the end, the gather information can be collected and saved to file. 

The generator can also create and save a bar-chart over the rainfall, highlighting the years chosen by user.
